# Line_Follower_Robot
Course project of CS684 (Embedded system)
 
## Introduction
This repository contains the simulation files and code for a line follower robot implemented in CoppeliaSim. The line follower robot is designed to navigate along a path marked by a contrasting line on the ground. The robot uses sensors to detect the line and adjust its movements to stay on the track.

## Requirements

CoppeliaSim: You need to have CoppeliaSim installed on your system to run this simulation. CoppeliaSim is a versatile robot simulation platform that allows you to create and simulate robotic systems.

## How it works

The line follower robot uses infrared sensors to detect the line on the ground. The sensors are placed in a configuration that allows the robot to determine its position relative to the line. The robot's control algorithm adjusts the motor speeds based on the sensor readings to keep the robot on the line.

## Configuration
You can configure the Line Follower Robot's behaviour by adjusting parameters in the simulation:

Speed: Modify the robot's speed settings to control how fast it follows the line.
Sensor Sensitivity: Adjust the sensor sensitivity to make the robot respond differently to the line's colour.

## Customization
Feel free to customize the simulation to enhance your learning or experiment with different concepts:

Algorithm Experimentation: Try implementing different algorithms for line following and compare their performance.
Sensor Placement: Experiment with the placement of infrared sensors to see how it affects the robot's behaviour.
Environment Design: Modify the simulation environment by adding obstacles, different track designs, or additional challenges.
